## Abstract

This project aims to explore the 2012 Workplace Fatalities by State dataset. By delving into the various elements of this dataset, users can comprehend the diverse factors and relationships that yield valuable insights. The dataset utilized in the project encompasses specific workplace variables from all states in the United States. These variables include, but are not limited to, the total and rate of fatalities per state, the total and rate of injuries/illnesses per state, as well as the categorization of states by program types. This dataset was employed to conduct descriptive statistical analysis. Additionally, I addressed several prominent questions from the dataset while presenting the results through data visualization tools.

## Business Problem

Workplace fatalities and injuries/illnesses are very important topics. Identifying the most impacted state is crucial in implementing measures to decrease rates nationwide. Prioritizing workplace safety benefits both employers and employees across various organizations. This analysis emphasizes the role of Federal and State-run programs in addressing fatalities and injuries/illnesses within workplaces by state. By focusing on the variables potentially contributing to increased rates, we can pinpoint states needing to review workplace regulations and policies.

## Data

The dataset used for this project was the 2012 Workplace Fatalities by State. This data was obtained directly through the school portal and made available by the instructor. In this project, I had to manipulate the data to create a clear format. The cleanup aspects help determine which variables are the most important in the dataset and which variables we should exclude. In addition to the data provided, I also included an additional column for a more in-depth analysis comparison. To provide a more comprehensive analysis, I added the “Region” column to help break out the data into a more consolidated view.  Please note that the original data is saved separately from the manipulated data to be able to distinguish the changes that were made.

## Methods

The dataset was manipulated by adding and deleting necessary columns to organize the information in a table or pivot table. Filters and slicers were used to summarize and query only the needed information. Following this, a statistical analysis of the dataset was performed. This information was then used to make additional inferences using a Histogram that showed the Total Number of Fatalities by Region. Additionally, a series of visualization models, including pie charts, bar graphs, and scatter plots, were created to complete the additional analysis and address the main objectives of the dataset.

## Conclusion

Based on the analysis, we identified some significant components in the dataset. Between the two programs, federal programs have the highest rate of fatalities, exceeding state programs by 18%.  I also identified the state program with the highest number of injuries/illnesses, which is California. Because the dataset contains several important variables, it was crucial to see if some variables depend on one another. After completing a correlation analysis, it was concluded that there is a positive relationship indicating that the "Average number of years to inspect workplace once" correlates with the "Number of Fatalities". The longer it takes to inspect each workplace once, the higher the fatality rate will be. However, the dataset does have three outliers (Alaska, North Dakota, and Wyoming). Without more information, it is not possible to determine what could cause these states to be outliers. Further analysis also identified the top five states that had the highest penalties. Lastly, we also identified another positive relationship between the “Penalties FY 2013” and the “Number of Inspectors” by state and program type. 

Although we could make some insightful inferences from the data, having multiple years included in the data set would help make a more accurate analysis. Also, exploring the data at a finer level, such as knowing the workplace by industry or the number of worksites within each state, would add additional depth to the analysis. Overall, the analysis made from the dataset should be viewed as a broad overview with limited parameters.
